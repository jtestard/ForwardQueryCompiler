    <entry path="/Select/menu/options/option/enabled">Enables or disables the component. Does nothing if this state transition is disallowed. If the component is both visible and focusable, updates its focused state and tab index as needed. If the component is being disabled, ensures that it is also deactivated and un-highlighted first. Note that the component&#39;s enabled/disabled state is &quot;locked&quot; as long as it is hosted in a goog.ui.Container that is itself disabled; this is to prevent clients from accidentally re-enabling a control that is in a disabled container.</entry>
    <entry path="/Select/menu/options/option/content">Text caption or DOM structure to display as the content of the item (use to add icons or styling to menus).</entry>
